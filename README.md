#Tree(√Årvore)

This was a data structures' class assignment where we implemented tree algorithms, inserted data into them, and did some operations. For example, inserting data
provided by the professor into a tree and finding the max value of that tree and saving the result in one output file. Another question asked us to execute inOr-
derTreeWalk and print the output to a file.
